Generate a complete, clear, and well-structured specification for the following application:

Application Overview

An In-Memory Python Console-Based Todo Application that allows users to manage tasks during a single program session.
No data persistence is required; all data exists only in memory while the application is running.

Functional Requirements

The application must support the following features:

Add Task

Create a new todo item

Each task must include:

Unique task ID

Task title

Optional description

Completion status (default: incomplete)

Delete Task

Remove an existing task by its ID

Handle invalid or non-existent task IDs gracefully

Update Task

Modify an existing task’s title and/or description

Allow partial updates

Preserve completion status unless explicitly changed

View Task List

Display all tasks in a readable, numbered format

Clearly indicate completed vs incomplete tasks

Show task ID, title, and status

Mark Task as Complete

Toggle completion status (complete ↔ incomplete)

Identify task by ID

Console Interaction Requirements

The app must be menu-driven

Display a numbered menu with available actions

Accept user input via standard input

Validate all inputs and display user-friendly error messages

Continue running until the user explicitly chooses to exit

Non-Functional Requirements

Written in Python

In-memory data storage only (no files, no databases)

Clear separation of concerns:

Task model

Business logic

Console UI

Readable, maintainable, and testable structure

Avoid external dependencies

Data Model

Define a Task entity with:

id: int

title: str

description: str

is_completed: bool

Constraints

No persistence across runs

No GUI or web interface

Python standard library only
