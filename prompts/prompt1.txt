You are a principal software architect and governance designer.

Your task is to produce a Project Constitution in Markdown format using Spec-Kit Plus standards.
This Constitution will govern all design, specification, implementation, and AI-assisted development decisions for the project described below.

📘 Project Title

Evolution of Todo – A 5-Phase Spec-Driven AI-Native Todo Platform

🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this Constitution is to:

Enforce Spec-Driven Development

Define non-negotiable architectural rules

Control Claude Code’s implementation behavior

Ensure consistency across all 5 hackathon phases

Prevent manual coding and ad-hoc design decisions

This Constitution must be binding for every future spec and feature.

🧱 Core Governance Principles

The Constitution must explicitly define and enforce:

Spec-First Mandate

No feature may be implemented without an approved Spec

Specs must be written and refined before code generation

Claude Code is the only entity allowed to generate code

No Manual Code Rule

The developer may not write code by hand

If output is incorrect, the Spec must be refined—not the code

Incremental Phase Evolution

Each phase builds strictly on the previous one

No skipping or leaking of future-phase features

Deterministic AI Behavior

Claude Code must:

Follow specs literally

Avoid assumptions not stated in specs

Reject ambiguous instructions

Separation of Concerns

Specs, Constitution, and Implementation are independent artifacts

Business logic, UI, AI agents, and infrastructure must remain decoupled

🧩 Required Constitutional Sections

The Constitution must include the following sections (with clear headings):

1. Scope & Boundaries

What the project includes

What it explicitly excludes

Phase-based scope control

2. Development Methodology

Spec-Driven Development workflow

Spec → Review → Refine → Generate → Validate loop

Acceptance criteria enforcement

3. Phase Governance Rules

Define immutable rules for each phase:

Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App
(Python, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code)

Phase II: Full-Stack Web App
(Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB)

Phase III: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot
(OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, MCP SDK)

Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment
(Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, kagent)

Phase V: Cloud-Native Deployment
(Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean Kubernetes)

Each phase must define:

Allowed technologies

Disallowed shortcuts

Required deliverables

4. Feature Evolution Contract

Define rules governing the Todo feature progression:

Basic Level

Add Task

Delete Task

Update Task

View Task List

Mark as Complete

Intermediate Level

Priorities & Tags

Search & Filter

Sorting

Advanced Level

Recurring Tasks

Due Dates & Reminders

Agent-assisted task management

Include rules preventing premature implementation.

5. AI Agent Governance

Define constitutional rules for:

Natural language task management

Use of OpenAI ChatKit

Use of Agents SDK & MCP

Intent parsing vs execution separation

Safety, determinism, and traceability

6. Infrastructure & Deployment Rules

Specify:

Local vs cloud deployment separation

Kubernetes constraints

Environment parity rules

No infrastructure without specs

7. Bonus Feature Governance

Define how bonus features are allowed:

Subagents & Agent Skills

Cloud-Native Blueprints

Multi-language support (Urdu)

Voice commands

Each bonus must:

Be isolated

Be spec-approved

Never destabilize core features

8. Failure Handling & Enforcement

Define:

What happens when specs are violated

When Claude Code must refuse to generate code

How conflicts are resolved (Constitution > Spec > Implementation)

🧾 Tone & Style Requirements

Professional

Declarative and authoritative

Clear “MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD” language

No implementation details

Markdown formatted

Suitable for real-world engineering governance

📦 Output Requirements

Output only the Markdown Constitution

No explanations

No summaries

No emojis

No code blocks

This Constitution will be used as the supreme governing document for all future Specs and AI-generated code.
