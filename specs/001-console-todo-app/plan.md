# Implementation Plan: Console Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-console-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-31 | **Spec**: [link](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of an in-memory Python console-based todo application that allows users to manage tasks during a single program session. The application provides menu-driven interface with add, view, update, delete, and mark complete functionality. All data exists only in memory while the application is running with no persistence across runs.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.8+ (as specified in spec)
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (as specified in spec)
**Storage**: N/A - In-memory only (as specified in spec)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application - determines source structure
**Performance Goals**: <100ms response time for all operations, support 100+ tasks in memory without degradation
**Constraints**: No external dependencies, in-memory only operation, menu-driven interface, sequential task IDs starting from 1

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Spec-First Mandate Compliance
✅ Specification exists and is approved before code generation
✅ Specs written and refined before code generation
✅ Claude Code will be used as the only entity to generate code

### No Manual Code Rule Compliance
✅ Python implementation will be generated by Claude Code only
✅ No manual code writing by human developers

### Incremental Phase Evolution Compliance
✅ This is Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App with core todo functionality
✅ Following the correct phase sequence as specified in constitution
✅ No features from future phases will be implemented

### Deterministic AI Behavior Compliance
✅ Implementation will follow specifications literally
✅ No assumptions beyond what's stated in the spec
✅ Claude Code will reject ambiguous instructions

### Separation of Concerns Compliance
✅ Specs, Constitution, and Implementation are independent artifacts
✅ Clear separation between business logic, UI (console), and data management

### Feature Evolution Contract Compliance
✅ Implementing Basic Level features: Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark as Complete
✅ No Intermediate or Advanced level features will be implemented in this phase
✅ Following strict sequence as defined in constitution

### Phase Governance Rules Compliance
✅ Technologies: Python, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code (as specified)
✅ Requirements: Core todo functionality in console interface (as specified)
✅ Disallowed: GUI interfaces, persistent storage, network connectivity (compliant)
✅ All constraints from constitution are being followed

**Structure Decision**: Single console application structure selected based on spec requirements for in-memory Python console app. The structure separates concerns with models for data, services for business logic, cli for user interface, and lib for utilities. Tests are organized by type (unit, integration, contract) to ensure proper validation at all levels.
