## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for todo app CLI enhancement following the spec-driven approach. Created 30 specific tasks organized by user story priority (P1, P2) with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. Tasks cover all required features: emoji indicators, default incomplete status, visual styling, and CLI editing capability. Each task follows the required format with ID, story labels, and specific file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No tests created yet (task generation phase)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with detailed implementation tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user stories for independent implementation
